          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm a software engineer who loves turning ideas into intuitive,
            user-friendly web applications. Bringing a product to life—from
            concept to polished experience—is what excites me most.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in frontend development, crafting sleek and responsive
            interfaces with TypeScript, Vue, and React. While UI/UX is my main
            focus, I enjoy exploring the full stack to build seamless,
            well-rounded applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in May 2021 with
            a B.S. in Computer Science. Always eager to learn and grow, I'm open
            to new opportunities that push my skills and expand my horizons.
          </p>
          <p>Check out my projects and feel free to reach out!</p>
