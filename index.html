      <p>
        I am a software engineer with a passion for building easy-to-use web
        apps. I love building software, and seeing a vision for a product or
        application come to life. My area of focus tends to be the
        UI/frontend, creating the applications that users see. The main
        technologies I enjoy working with are TypeScript, using Vue or React
        to build user interfaces. I graduated Rochester Institute of
        Technology in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I
        am always open to new opportunities and advancing my career.
