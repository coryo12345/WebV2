            <p>I am a software engineer, currently looking for a full time job. I graduated from Rochester Intitute of
                Technology with B.S. in Computer Science, in May 2021. My experience and interests can be split into two
                categories. The first is data science. I enjoy working with Python and SQL to explore and analyze data.
                These languages are excellent tools for rapid development, which allow me to quickly create programs or
                scripts which will analyze or process data. The second category is web development. I have plenty of
                experience working with Javascript, both NodeJS and standard ES6 for the web. The main library I have
                experience with is React for front-end development. I have used it for both web developement, and for
                mobile app development, using React Native. There is a more complete list of skills on my resume, which
                you can find below. I have also listed some of the projects I have worked on, which I would encourage
                you to check out.</p>

            <h2>Things To Check Out</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/coryo12345/DiscGolfShuffle">DiscGolfShuffle Mobile App</a> - A mobile
                    app for IOS and Android written in React Native. Designed for casual play in groups, to mix up a
                    normal round with some fun twists.</li>
                <li><a href="/assets/NYC_traffic_report.pdf">Analysis of Vehicular Accidents in New York City</a> - A
                    data science project, where I worked in a small group to analyze the traffic collisions in New York
                    City before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We assumed that because of the pandemic, there would be
                    less accidents during this time, as there would be less people on the roads. This report has all of
                    our findings, including graphs, plots, and our development strategies.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/coryo12345/WhiteElephant">White Elephant!</a> (Demo <a
                        href="https://gift.corydio.com">here</a>) - A small Web Application I designed for our family
                    White Elephant gift exchange every Christmas. We have some special rules where we roll dice for
                    special rules we have to follow. I turned this into a Web App with a lobby system.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/coryo12345/bashio-terminal">Simple Bash Emulator</a> (Demo <a
                        href="/terminal">here</a>) - A fun exercise in string manipulation and data types. I tried to
                    emulate a simple bash terminal, with a handful of commands. I had to design my own data structures
                    to represent files on the "system", and find matching commands from user input. This was great
                    practice at making command line interfaces.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/coryo12345/clock">JS Canvas Clock</a> (Demo <a href="/clock">here</a>) -
                    A quick analog clock that runs as a standalone app using Electron. I created this to learn electron,
                    and updated it for demonstration purposes. The demo runs in the browser, with no downloads or
                    installs.</li>
